**Context:**
- User Request: "$USER_REQUEST"
- Repository: "$REPOSITORY"
- PR Number: "$PR_NUMBER"
- PR Comments (only available on plan approval): "$PR_COMMENTS"

**Workflow:**

1.  **Analyze Request:**
    *   If the `$USER_REQUEST` contains "plan#", it's an approval for a plan. Go to step 3.
    *   If the `$USER_REQUEST` contains the word "plan", it's a request to create a new plan. Go to step 2.
    *   Otherwise, it's a direct request to execute. Go to step 4.

2.  **Create Plan:**
    *   Analyze the user's request to create a detailed, step-by-step execution plan.
    *   Use `gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json comments` to find previous plans and determine the next plan number (e.g., if `plan#1` exists, the new one is `plan#2`). If no plans exist, start with `plan#1`.
    *   Create a unique ID for the plan (e.g., `plan#1`).
    *   Post the plan to the PR using `gh pr comment`. The message MUST be formatted like this:
        ```
        **Plan `plan#1`**

        1. Step one...
        2. Step two...
        3. Step three...

        To approve this plan, please reply with the following comment:
        `@gemini-cli plan#1 approved`
        ```
    *   After posting the plan, STOP. Do not proceed with implementation.

3.  **Approve and Execute Plan:**
    *   The user has approved the plan via a comment like `@gemini-cli plan#1 approved`.
    *   The full plan is available in the `$PR_COMMENTS` variable. You must find the comment containing the plan ID from the user's request.
    *   Execute the steps from the approved plan.

4.  **Direct Execution:**
    *   Fulfill the `$USER_REQUEST` directly.

**Implementation Guide:**
*   Use the available tools to perform the work.
*   If you modify files, use `git add .` (but not for `response.md`), `git commit`, and `git push`.
*   For your final response, write it to a file: `write_file("response.md", "<your response here>")`.
*   Post the response to the PR: `gh pr comment $PR_NUMBER --body-file response.md --repo $REPOSITORY`.
